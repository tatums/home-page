              Kelly and Brian went to high school together at OPRF.  In high school Brian was busy being a punk rocker, and Kelly was all about gymnastics. They barely crossed paths, but did have a few clases de Espa√±ol together. Towards the end of h.s. and throughout college they hung out with mutual friends. It wasn't until they both moved home after college without jobs that they started dating while mooching off their parents, trying to get on their feet. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Many nights were spent trying every restaurant in Oak Park and at Healy's on Madison in Forest Park with friends. Kelly and Brian quickly became close, spending time together, meeting each other's friends and family, quoting the Simpsons and Kelly trying to convince Brian and the Shams that she should join the band with her tambourining expertise. Once employed, they each moved to Lakeview on the northside of Chicago to live the city life with friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              After 4 and a half years of dating, Brian popped the question while spending a December weekend at his family's house in Lake Geneva. He surprised her with a full night including flowers, dinner reservations and of course a beautiful ring. They decided that night they would get married on June 14, 2014 - Flag Day!
